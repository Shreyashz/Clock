# Clock
 Here is a clock that I made using Javascript and HTML CSS. I observed that I needed a clock for me to watch weather I am studying or coding it's so easy to forget the time while doing those I tried few softwares but most of them are not all at one place. Which is what I don't want. So, I decided I should make m y own. The way I want minimal and easy to use and load as well.
